* Maximum Likelihood Estimation and Bayesian Inference in Analytically Tractable Models

#### Tue, Jan 23

 * **In class**, we will work on:
    * Introduction to Maximum Likelihood Estimation: capture-recapture [pdf](lectures/20180123_mle/20180123_capture_recapture.pdf)
    * Other materials: Summary of common discrete distributions [pdf](lectures/20180123_mle/20180123_discrete_distributions_summary.pdf)

#### Thu, Jan 25

 * **Before class**, please do the following:
    * **Fill out** a brief [questionnairre](https://goo.gl/forms/vIsi277yi74DrswL2)
    * **Fill out** this poll about when my office hours should be held: [http://whenisgood.net/5h5dzyy](http://whenisgood.net/5h5dzyy)
    * **Sign up** for our class at gryd.us (the site where we will use R starting Thursday!): [https://beta.gryd.us/course/pASBfTReABjoxzuzQv2g2J/register/](https://beta.gryd.us/course/pASBfTReABjoxzuzQv2g2J/register/)
    * **Sign up** for our class at Piazza (anonymous question and answer forum): [https://piazza.com/mtholyoke/spring2018/stat343](https://piazza.com/mtholyoke/spring2018/stat343)
    * **Reading**
      * Section 7.1: just skim this section, but do pay attention to Definitions 7.1.1, 7.1.2, 7.1.3, and 7.1.4.
      * Section 7.5: Pay attention to Definitions 7.5.1 and 7.5.2. Work through one or two of the examples.
      * Sections 7.2 and 7.3: Read somewhat carefully, but we will cover this in class today.
 * **In class**, we will work on:
    * Example of Maximum Likelihood Estimation: friend or foe [pdf](lectures/20180125_mle_continued/20180125_mle_friend_or_foe.pdf)
    * If time: Example of Maximum Likelihood Estimation: seedlings [pdf](lectures/20180123_mle/20180123_seedlings.pdf)
    * State some definitions related to MLE more carefully: Definitions 7.2.3/7.5.1 (it's the same definition repeated to emphasize its importance), 7.4.1, and 7.5.2.
    * Introduction to the idea of subjective probabilities
 * **After class**, please do the following:
    * Review material from today's class.  Post on Piazza or visit my office if you have any questions!
    * If you didn't have time to look at the seedlings example of MLE, I recommend you take a look at it; ask if you have questions!

#### Fri, Jan 26
 * **Before Class**, please do the following:
    * **Reading**
      * Finish a first pass at reading Sections 7.1, 7.2, 7.3, and 7.5 of DeGroot and Schervish
 * **In Class**, we will work on:
    * Finish our introduction to maximum likelihood estimation (we will talk about this much more in future weeks)
    * Introduction to the idea of subjective probability distributions

#### Tue, Feb 6
 * **Before Class**, please do the following:
    * If you were unable to get the first lab committed to github, take another look at that over the weekend (but don't spend too much time on this).  If you're still stuck on Monday, let me know and we can work through it together.
    * Try cloning the first problem set (PS1) from GitHub to Gryd.  The link to the assignment on GitHub is on the homework page.
    * Start on PS1.
 * **In Class**, we will do the following:
