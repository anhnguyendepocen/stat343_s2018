* Maximum Likelihood Estimation and Bayesian Inference in Analytically Tractable Models

#### Tue, Jan 23

 * **In class**, we will work on:
    * Introduction to Maximum Likelihood Estimation: capture-recapture [pdf](lectures/20180123_mle/20180123_capture_recapture.pdf)
    * Other materials: Summary of common discrete distributions [pdf](lectures/20180123_mle/20180123_discrete_distributions_summary.pdf)

#### Thu, Jan 25

 * **Before class**, please do the following:
    * **Fill out** a brief [questionnairre](https://goo.gl/forms/vIsi277yi74DrswL2)
    * **Fill out** this poll about when my office hours should be held: [http://whenisgood.net/5h5dzyy](http://whenisgood.net/5h5dzyy)
    * **Sign up** for our class at gryd.us (the site where we will use R starting Thursday!): [https://beta.gryd.us/course/pASBfTReABjoxzuzQv2g2J/register/](https://beta.gryd.us/course/pASBfTReABjoxzuzQv2g2J/register/)
    * **Sign up** for our class at Piazza (anonymous question and answer forum): [https://piazza.com/mtholyoke/spring2018/stat343](https://piazza.com/mtholyoke/spring2018/stat343)
    * **Reading**
      * Section 7.1: just skim this section, but do pay attention to Definitions 7.1.1, 7.1.2, 7.1.3, and 7.1.4.
      * Section 7.5: Pay attention to Definitions 7.5.1 and 7.5.2. Work through one or two of the examples.
      * Sections 7.2 and 7.3: Read somewhat carefully, but we will cover this in class today.
 * **In class**, we will work on:
    * Example of Maximum Likelihood Estimation: friend or foe [pdf](lectures/20180125_mle_continued/20180125_mle_friend_or_foe.pdf)
    * If time: Example of Maximum Likelihood Estimation: seedlings [pdf](lectures/20180123_mle/20180123_seedlings.pdf)
    * State some definitions related to MLE more carefully: Definitions 7.2.3/7.5.1 (it's the same definition repeated to emphasize its importance), 7.4.1, and 7.5.2.
    * Introduction to the idea of subjective probabilities
 * **After class**, please do the following:
    * Review material from today's class.  Post on Piazza or visit my office if you have any questions!
    * If you didn't have time to look at the seedlings example of MLE, I recommend you take a look at it; ask if you have questions!

#### Fri, Jan 26
 * **Before Class**, please do the following:
    * **Reading**
      * Finish a first pass at reading Sections 7.1, 7.2, 7.3, and 7.5 of DeGroot and Schervish

    * Finish our introduction to maximum likelihood estimation (we will talk about this much more in future weeks)
    * Introduction to the idea of subjective probability distributions
