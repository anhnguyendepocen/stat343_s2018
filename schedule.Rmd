#### Tue, Feb 6
 * **Before Class**, please do the following:
    * If you were unable to get the first lab committed to github, take another look at that over the weekend (but don't spend too much time on this).  If you're still stuck on Monday, let me know and we can work through it together.

#### Tue, Feb 20
 * **In class**, we will do the following:
    * Discuss Bias, Variance, and Mean Squared Error (MSE) of estimators.  In Schervish, this is covered in Section 8.7, and the first couple of pages of Section 7.9.  In Rice, this is not covered particularly systematically anywhere; the closest we can get is in Section 7.3.1 and Section 4.2.1.
    * I added example calculations of bias, variance, and MSE based on simulation-based approximation to sampling distribuiton to the example from last class (see notebook viewer)
    * Start a lab using these ideas; you have been added as a collaborator on a GitHub repository.

#### Thu, Feb 22
 * Continue lab

#### Fri, Feb 23
 * Finish lab

**Midterm 1; covers material from PS1 and PS2**

 * **Readings for the next couple of weeks**:
    * The Law of Large Numbers and Monte Carlo Integration: Section 5.2 of Rice has a good introduction to the ideas; see Theorem A and Example A [here](resources/readings/rice_mc_integration.pdf).  Related material is also in Section 6.2 in DeGroot and Schervish, especially Theorems 6.2.4 through 6.2.6.
    * Sections about Bayesian Inference and MCMC from \"Introduction to Statistical Thought\" by Lavine: [pdf](resources/readings/lavine_bayes_mcmc.pdf).  The models used in that text are more complicated than the models we're using in the class at this point, but this is the best introductory discussion of MCMC I could find.  In case you're interested, the full text is available [here](http://people.math.umass.edu/~lavine/Book/book.html).
